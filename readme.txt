Tic-tac-toe is made up of three files, i.e ttt.cpp which is the main function, ttt_functions.cpp which stores all the necessary functions and ttt_functions.hpp which is the declaration file. 

Generally, this code snippet is aimed at practicing how to create functions, make declarations, and find bugs using c++. Specifically, the tic-tac-toe game is built upon a 2-D vector which is a little tricky for the beginner of c++ programmers.
